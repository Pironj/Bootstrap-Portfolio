                <p class="card-text">I'm a midwest transplant who recently decided to switch careers. I currently am
                    working in the food &
                    beverage industry and took a step down from my role as a director of operationsto dedicate myself to
                    going back to school. I am a people person and tend to be very easy going. I get along well with my
                    peers and thrive when problem solving collaboratively as well as on solo projects. I have managed
                    four separate businesses grossing over $4M in annual revenue. I have gained the respect of my
                    employees and treat everyone fairly and with respect. I am very much looking forward to
                    collaborating with like minded individuals on new problems in my future career. Intro into
                    discovering UW's Coding Bootcamp for full-stack web development and jumpstarted my progress into a
                    new career. I have dabbled with code in the past and decided to take the plunge and get the ball
                    rolling for myself and my family.</p>
                <p class="card-text">I am newly and happily married, and very excited to be starting this next chapter
                    in my life. My wife
                    and I have a goal to move to Hawaii while we are still young. I am animal lover and care for two fur
                    babies currently, but soon to be more in the future.</p>
